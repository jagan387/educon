Description
===========

This project aims to help bridge the gap between Professors and Students in a University like atmosphere, by easing the interaction b/w the concerned parites through meetings.

A student who wishes to communicate with a professor, after looking at his public schedule, can request for a meeting at a particular time. The student can also view/manage his various requests with different professors.

A professor can accept/reject a students request, with/without mentioning a reason. This update will be sent to the respective student through both a mail as well as an SMS on his registered mobile number. The professor can also update his public schedule continuously
